# Gaussian noise on LeNet experiment

This is a **IPython Jupiter Notebook** file which can run on **google cloud computing platform**. It's function is to do a simple experiment: add Gaussian noise to the input of Lenet nueral network and test the output. This is the practice part of *stochastic process* class project.
